# Setup from scratch
1. Create a new file `~/.vimrc` on your local machine (if it doesn't exist already)
2. Copy the contents of .vimrc from this repo to your local file
3. Set up [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim): 
    -  Run the following command $`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
    -  Launch `vim` and run `:PluginInstall`
    -  Or to install from the command line, run $`vim +PluginInstall +qall`
4. Now if the latest configs aren't loaded in vim, run the following command inside vim:
    - `:source ~/.vimrc`
